## ✨ What is Shuffle-Puffle?

**Shuffle-Puffle** is a mod for **Balatro** that tosses in a chaotic cocktail of:

- 🎭 **New Jokers** with fresh & freaky effects  
- 🪄 **Tarot & Planet cards** to shake up your plays  
- 🃏 **Custom Decks** that start your run off *weird*  
- 🔮 Future mechanics and experimental concepts brewing in the lab...

It’s *vanilla-friendly* for now. But who knows what puffled nightmares we’ll cook up later? 😈

## 🃏 Current Additions

### ✅ Jokers

- **deckhugger** – Gains coins when your hand has **zero face cards**. That’s right. No Kings. No Queens. No fun…? Nah, it’s *all* about that common grind.

*(More Jokers rolling out as we brainstorm and animate.)*
